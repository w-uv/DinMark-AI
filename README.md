# TO DO
Instructions:
    Implement an agent (at least reflex agent) that works in the MINI-CASINO WORLD. The environment is defined as follows:
    -The mini-casino has two (2) slot machines
    -It costs Php 1 to play in a machine. Each play takes 10 seconds to finish.
    -Possible pay-offs for the machine: Php 0, 1, 5, or 100

The user inputs the following:
    1. Amount of money to start with
    2. Total play time
    3. Pay-off chances for every machine

The aim of the agent is to end up with as much money as possible. As you run the program, the user will be asked of the details as specified in the input above. 
Your program will then display a narrative description of what happens in the environment (e.g. the pay-off from the slot machine, the actions of the agent, etc.).
